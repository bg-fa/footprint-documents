**Advanced wallet labeling**&#x20;

The Footprint database has generated tags by category for the DeFi platform. And now it supports users to tag reports and dashboards, so users can quickly search for the report templates they need based on the tags.

Footprint plans to launch the labeling section. It tracks and labels every individual wallet address exchange, meaning you can see which addresses are accumulating or selling off specific tokens, plus their portfolio profits, allowing you to do hyper-targeted research or unlock macro DeFi market trends. With token metrics for usage, engagement, and liquidity, you can make informed decisions before and after investing.

Cryptocurrency transactions involving multiple chains, projects, and wallets are a big challenge for developers and data analysts regarding data volume and complexity. For data analysis platforms, collecting and organizing standardized data structures takes a lot of time and effort and requires constant investment in long-term maintenance. Because of the complexity of the data, most of the analytics tools on the market only realize the overall statistics or part of the chain's data, and there are almost no platforms that can provide microscopic data granularity that can be tracked to individual behaviors like Footprint.

With the gradual development of blockchain multi-chain ecology, data analysis will usher in more excellent development opportunities. As a new star of data analysis platform, Footprint will bring more surprises to the DeFi field and users with its pleasant, simple operation experience and data capabilities.
