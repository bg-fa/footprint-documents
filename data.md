# ‚õè Data

Footprint Analytics gets logs directly from chains and parses the contracts. Blockchain logs are parsed into events and transactions. Consequently raw data is aggregated into a cashflow table. Data is constantly updated.

We also support the parsing of contracts on the chain, and you can submit your contract address to get the on-chain data on Footprint Analytics. Feel free to contact the admin on Telegram or Discord.
