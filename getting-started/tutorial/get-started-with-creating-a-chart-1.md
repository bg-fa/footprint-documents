# Get Started with Creating a Chart

Footprint Analytics is a simple and powerful online tool that allows anyone to analyze on-chain data without technical requirements.

The first step to starting an analysis is to create a basic chart.This guide will help you create a visual chart on Footprint Analytics using 2 basic examples.

In this article:

* Using Template for a Chart
* Using Dataset for a Chart

### Using a Template for a Chart <a href="#_9qs0vlzhzb0x" id="_9qs0vlzhzb0x"></a>

Starting off can be overwhelming, but don’t worry, by changing some settings or filters, you can quickly turn our provided templates into your own usable charts..

Let's create a Combo chart of $SOL: Token Price & Trading Volume per day. This chart shows us the changes in SOL Token prices as well as how many SOL Tokens are traded each day, visually representing the data in an easy-to-consume way.

Step 1: On the top right hand-side of the screen, click on **Create.** A pop-up menu will appear.

Step 2: Select **New Chart**.

Step 3: Select the template **Avalanche: Token Price & Trading Volume** on the bottom on the screen.

Step 5: Type in your desired filters. For this example, we will be changing AVAX to **sol**. Type in **sol** into the search bar and select sol. Don’t forget to click on the **X mark** on AVAX to exclude it from our filters.

Step 6: Click on **Update** and your chart will rearrange itself accordingly.

Step 7: Make sure you click on **Save** to finalize your chart.

Step 8: Change the chart **Name** and the **Description** before clicking **Save** again.

Then, the chart is done. You can access charts you’ve made under **My Analytics** at the top of your screen. Click on **Chart** and **Select** your chart.

### Using a Dataset for a Chart <a href="#_an3nyf4rvvti" id="_an3nyf4rvvti"></a>

Besides the above one-click duplication method, you can also create your own charts step by step. For creative graphs or data, this is a more flexible way to go.

Use case: Let's make a line chart of the number of Ethereum transactions per day.

Step 1: Click on **Create** and select **New Chart**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/11)

The image above shows users how to create a new chart based on Steps 1 and 2.

Step 2: Select Ethereum. A drop-down menu will appear.

Step 3: Select the data table **ethereum\_transactions**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/12)

The image above shows users which graph to select and where to find the graph for the purpose of our example in this article.

![The gif above demonstrates Steps 1 to 3, the process of getting to ethereum\_transactions for the purpose of this guide.](../../.gitbook/assets/13)



Step 3: In the “ethereum\_transactions” table, there is one record for each transaction, which means you can directly count the number of records and group by day. Click **Summarize** in the upper right corner, and then pick **Count of rows**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/14)

The image above shows users how to summarize by count of rows according to Steps 1 to 3.

Step 4: Under the **Group-by** field, scroll down and select **block\_timestamp**, which needs to be grouped **by day**.

![The image above shows users to scroll down for block\_timestamp under the Group-by field for Step 4.](../../.gitbook/assets/15)



![The image above is a continuation of Step 4, showing users how to select by day under block\_timestamp.](../../.gitbook/assets/16)



![The gif above combines Steps 3 and 4, navigating how to select Count of rows and block\_timestamp by day.](../../.gitbook/assets/17)



Always make sure to save your chart.
