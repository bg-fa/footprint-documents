# How to Create a New Dashboard

Dashboards help to inform decisions. Dashboards are the combination of charts, and generally include different types of charts, like line charts, pie charts, and bar charts, etc. These charts are combined into a dashboard that shows the current data situation needed.

In Footprint Analytics, dashboards are pages where you can organize charts and text cards in a grid. This article will talk about how to use tools which Footprint provides.

Let's begin to create a dashboard.

Step1. Click **Create**, here we select **New dashboard**. Then，add the charts you need.

You can search for the chart you need in the search box,and you can also add charts from **My charts** or **Community charts**.

Then，your dashboard is done, save it.

After adding the charts you need, you can decorate and adjust your dashboard by using some tools.

* **Edit the Position and Size**

You can organize and make your dashboard more clear and good-looking. Combine different charts, put related data charts together to tell a story with data and improve readability.

**Tips**：Drag the bottom right corner of the chart to resize it.

* **Add A Text Box**

This is a great tool to display the Markdown or something else you want to present, such as illustrate the logic of metrics calculation and add introduction text to the dashboard.

* **Adding Filters to the Dashboard**

Get a new dashboard by changing the **Filter**, so that the dashboard can be used in a wider range of applications. It can reduce a lot of repetitive work.

It usually applied in:

1. **Dashboard templates**, to analyze different items (protocols, chains, tokens).
2. **Time filtering**, to easily change between different time ranges to show how trends change.

OK, let us get started.

Step1: Create a dashboard without any filter.

Because the filters are done by the dashboard's filter, so the basic chart doesn't need filters. Here is an example without filters.

If the charts you select have filters, you can delete the filters manually in **Advanced.**

Step2. For multiple charts, you can add a filter linkage. Click on **add a filter** on the top right corner, and select the type of filter you would like. You can choose **Time**, **ID**, and **Other Categories**.

Step3. Select the chart you need to associate with and set the Default Value. All the charts that need to be associated should be added.

If you don't need the filters, you can remove it by clicking **Remove.**
