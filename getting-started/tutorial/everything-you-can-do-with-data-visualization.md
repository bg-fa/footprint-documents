# Everything You Can Do with Data Visualization

Tables are often what you need when you’re working with a lot of fields. The table visualization in Footprint Analytics comes packed with features. In this article, we’ll explore some frequently used and useful functions.

* #### **Adding, Removing, and Editing Columns** <a href="#_jd3lygjvwg0e" id="_jd3lygjvwg0e"></a>

You can select which columns you’d like to include in the table. Remove the column by clicking on the **X** in the column settings, or add one.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/0 (5)>)

You can click and drag the columns to change their order.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/1 (4) (1)>)

* **Conditional Formatting**

You can add rules to make the cells in this table change color if they meet certain conditions.

You can highlight cells or rows based on the values they contain, which makes it easier for you to see value ranges and outliers. There are two types of conditional formatting: single color and color range.

**Single color:** When you want to color cells if the value in cells meets a certain criteria, use the single color option.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2 (3)>)

**Color range:** If you want to show the value’s relative position in the range of values for a column (or multiple columns), use the color range option.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/3 (3)>)

* **Column Settings**

You can change settings for each of the columns by clicking on column’s **gears icon.Example**

**Add Link**

You can add a **link** to the field, the link you add here defaults to the analysis content of Footprint, so here generally add the columns corresponding to the dashboard or database.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/4 (5) (1)>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/5 (1) (1)>)

#### **Mini Bar** <a href="#_iwffkaye5oyt" id="_iwffkaye5oyt"></a>

For scalar values, you can add a **mini bar chart** to show the value’s position within the range of values in the column (This function only applies to values).

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/6 (3)>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/7 (1) (1)>)
