# Line Chart

**Line charts** are used for plotting data captured in a sequence, whether the sequence is the passage of time or steps in a process or flow. line charts are typically used to plot a time series: a set of markers connected by lines, with the x-axis showing time and the y-axis plotting the value of a metric at each moment

Following the example of the _line chart of the number of Ethereum transactions per day_ of [Get Started with Creating a Chart.](../tutorial/get-started-with-creating-a-chart.md)

Let's plot the number of transactions on Ethereum for each month. Click on the **Summarize button** to pull up the **Summarize sidebar**. In the **Group by** section, mouse over the block\_timestamp field and click on the **by day** button to change the grouping to **by month**.

As soon as you change the grouping, Footprint updates the chart.

#### **Customizing Your Line Chart** <a href="#_9o63tr9edzo7" id="_9o63tr9edzo7"></a>

To customize your line chart, you can click on the **Visualization** button in the upper right and click on **Settings**. There are too many settings to cover here without boring you, so we’ll just give you some highlights.

#### **Display Tab** <a href="#_md8pqnn8ct5p" id="_md8pqnn8ct5p"></a>

The **Display tab** lets you change the line color and style, handle missing values, and so on.

#### **Trend Lines and Goal Lines** <a href="#_frojpzmlvfv2" id="_frojpzmlvfv2"></a>

For time series, toggle the trend line option and Footprint will auto-calculate a trend line. You can also add a goal line by specifying a value and a label.

#### **Axes Tab**

Here you can adjust the scale of the x and y-axes. For the x-axis, you can select either time series or ordinal scales. Time series will limit the number of values displayed, whereas the ordinal scale will list each value in the series along the x-axis. Use an ordinal scale if you’re plotting steps in a sequence.

For the y-axis, you can select linear (the default), or power or log scales. Logarithmic scales are great for showing the rate of change over time, especially when your data has an exponential rise or decay.

**Highlight**

When your chart has several series, you can hover over the name of a series in the chart to highlight it and fade out the other series.

When you hover over the line of the chart, you can see the information of the line.
