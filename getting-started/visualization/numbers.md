# Numbers

**Adding character prefixes or suffixes to it** (so you can do things like put a currency symbol in front or a percent at the end),&#x20;

**Setting the number of decimal places** you want to include, and&#x20;

**Multiplying your result by a number** (like if you want to multiply a decimal by 100 to make it look like a percent). If you want to divide by a number, then just multiply it by a decimal (e.g, if your result is 100, but you want it to display as 1, simply multiply it by 0.01).
