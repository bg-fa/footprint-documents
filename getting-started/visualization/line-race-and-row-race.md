# Line Race and Row Race

Line Race and Row Race are advanced applications of line charts, which can make your charts more vivid and visual.

* **Line Race**

It is used for plotting data captured in several sequences.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/0 (3)>)

**Use case:** Line Race - Comparison of Volumes

Step1: Select the data **nft-marketplaces-daily-stats** and add filters.

In this case, we make a comparison of trading volume of 3 NFT trading market in the past 30 days. So, we choose **protocol-name** and **day**.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/1 (1)>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2 (6)>)

Step2: Add summarize.

Here you can choose the metrics you need, then choose the field to group by. Note the choice of units for the time type field.

Click **Summarize**, in this case, we choose **sum of volume**, group by **protocol-name** and **day** (This operation displays data by day).

Step 3: Visualize.

Click **Visualize**, choose **Line Race**.Then, select the fields corresponding to x-axis, y-axis and category as required.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/4 (4)>)

In this case, we choose:

X-axis = day;

Y-axis = sum of volume;

Category = protocol-name;

OK, the chart is done.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/10 (1)>)

And you can set the display to change Animation Speed, Y-axis Maximum and Y-axis Emphasize.
