# Master the Bar Chart Visualization

Bar charts are great for displaying a number grouped by a category.

With bar charts you can compare groups of data with just a glance. One axis specifies the groups, while the other will quantify their count. The goal is to show big differences between the groups.

In this article, we will use an example to talk about how to create and edit a bar chart.

### **Create a Bar Chart** <a href="#guide-to-createabar-chart-and-customize-it-with-visualization-settings.-biao-ti-xia-mian-na-ju" id="guide-to-createabar-chart-and-customize-it-with-visualization-settings.-biao-ti-xia-mian-na-ju"></a>

Create a new chart, after choosing the data, click on the **Visualization** button in the upper right and choose **Bar**.

### **Bar Chart settings** <a href="#_1cak7yv028o6" id="_1cak7yv028o6"></a>

To customize your bar chart, click on **Settings** to alter the chart and achieve your desired aesthetic.

#### **Data** <a href="#_1moi5vqme9zl" id="_1moi5vqme9zl"></a>

If your dataset has more columns, you could choose to add or remove different columns here.

* **Stack Bar Chart**

If the data you’re visualizing can be broken down into multiple categories within a whole, consider using a stacked bar chart. Stacked bar charts display these different data points in smaller bars that stack on top of each other, and are useful if you want a visual representation of how these parts make up a whole and how that whole compares to others. A 100% stacked bar chart is similar, but displays those parts as relative percentages, so every bar spans the entire y-axis.

You can adjust this setting in the **Display** section of the **Settings sidebar**, by selecting **Stack** or **Stack - 100%**.

* **Set a Goal:** You can add a **goal line** that specifies where you want numbers to be.

In this example, we add a goal line at 50000 and name it Goal1.

#### **Axes** <a href="#_ykoqxvm45xoj" id="_ykoqxvm45xoj"></a>

Here you can adjust the scale of the x and y axes. For the x-axis, you can select either time series or ordinal scales. Time series will limit the number of values displayed, whereas the ordinal scale will list each value in the series along the x axis. Use an ordinal scale if you’re plotting steps in a sequence.

For the y-axis, you can select linear (the default), or power or log scales. Logarithmic scales are great for showing the rate of change over time, especially when your data has an exponential rise or decay.

Select Axes in the Settings sidebar.Here you can specify how you want your table organized.

Y-axis gives three options:

1. Linear
2. Power
3. Log

The linear option is selected automatically and for our example provides the most accurate representation of our data, so we’ll keep it.

With the **Show lines and marks** options you can change the way the categories and quantities are represented on each axis. The options for the y-axis are Hide, Show and Compact, while the x-axis has several more:

1. Hide
2. Show
3. Compact
4. Rotate 45˚
5. Rotate 90˚

And you can click **Auto y-axis range** or **Use a split y-axis when necessary** to change the chart **** if you need.

#### **Labels** <a href="#_arw3iud903wx" id="_arw3iud903wx"></a>

Select the **Labels** in the **Settings sidebar**.

Here, you can choose to show labels or not, or use the text boxes to enter the desired label for each axis.In this example, we show the label on x-axis to name and label on y-axis to volume.

Tips: It may take some back-and-forth to figure out which display settings are suitable for your data, so try a few different options to see what works best for you.
