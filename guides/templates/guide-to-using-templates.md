Footprint Analytics is a site packed with information that can get a little confusing at times when you’re just getting started. We have provided some free templates for users to get started with or even use for simplicity’s sake.

### Using Templates <a href="#_b6jfv8g66w3j" id="_b6jfv8g66w3j"></a>

Using these Dashboard Templates is easy, all you have to do is basically change the protocol name in the filter box and customize as desired.

To use a Template, we will be using two cases as examples.

Use Case 1:Using a filter box to get a new dashboard

Step 1: Click on the bar on the top left corner. For this example, we will be using the GameFi template, so ours will be called **GameFi Name**. It should already have **my-defi-pet** written under it. In our case, replace the filter with **starsharks,** then click Update.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/0 (6)>)

The image above shows where to replace the pre-existing filter with another GameFi name.

**Note**: _This is a one-off operation and the filter criteria will not be saved once the link is closed, so be sure to finish making your chart and save it._

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/1 (14)>)

The image above shows users where to update their filter.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2 (7)>)

The image above shows the updated template.

Use case 2: Getting a new chart by duplicating one

Step 1: Pick a chart you want to use and **duplicate** it using the **copy icon** on the top right corner of the chart.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/3 (4)>)

The image above shows where to find the copy icon to duplicate the chart.

Step 2: Click on the **edit** icon on the top right corner of the screen.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/4 (11)>)

The image above shows where to find the edit icon based on Step 2.

Step 3: Click on the text next to the blue filter icon on the top left side of the screen. For our example, change the filter from Farmers World to Axie Infinity.



![](<../../.gitbook/assets/5 (9)>)

The image above shows where to find the text next to the blue filter icon based on Step 3.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/6 (10)>)

The image above shows where to search and select Axie Infinity based on Step 3.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/7 (5)>)

The image above shows the end result after the change has been made in Step 3.

Don’t forget to save your chart. You can always check out the other templates. There are so many different filters, settings and more you can do with just these templates, so don’t hesitate to explore and try them all out.
