With the dashboard in place, we’re ready to design the dashboard in the next part.

### Designing Your Dashboard <a href="#_rq8ozhs6x9pp" id="_rq8ozhs6x9pp"></a>

With the dashboard ready, we can start designing your dashboard to personalize and organize for a cleaner and more legible look.

### Editing Positions and Sizes <a href="#_4c94p2ts9kpx" id="_4c94p2ts9kpx"></a>

You can move your charts and text boxes by simply clicking on them and then dragging them anywhere within the dashboard. Organize your dashboard items accordingly to improve readability.

### Adding a Text Box <a href="#_7xewegi9yvoh" id="_7xewegi9yvoh"></a>

**A Text Box** provides a space for you to display plain text in your dashboard. This is a great tool to illustrate the logic of metrics calculation, add introduction text to the dashboard, add notes to correlate your charts, and more.

To add a text box:

Step 1: Click on **Add a media box** on the top right hand-side of the screen.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/11 (2) (1)>)

The image above shows where you can find the option to add a text box.

Step 2: Select **Text**. A text box will appear on your dashboard. You can edit its position and size similar to charts, by dragging on their respective bottom-right handles.

The image above shows what a text box would look like in your dashboard.

The gif above demonstrates how to add a text box from Step 1 to 2.

### Visualization Options <a href="#_pzq4gm3bat8" id="_pzq4gm3bat8"></a>

Dashboard items each have a submenu that pops up on their top right corners upon hovering your mouse on them. One of the submenu items is the **Visualization options**, which is used for modifying dashboard item attributes, such as its Display, Axes, and Labels. To use the Visualization Option:

Step 1: **Hover** your mouse over your desired chart or text box. The **submenu** will pop up on the top right corner of this chart or text box.

Step 2: Click on the **Palette icon**.

The image above shows users where the palette icon is on the submenu of the hovered chart or text box from Step 2.

Step 3: Pop-up settings will appear. You can set how you want your chart or text box to be presented in your dashboard with settings including **Display**, **Axes** and **Labels**.

The image above shows the different options users can set upon clicking on the Visualization options as indicated by the palette icon in Step 1.

Step 4: Scroll down and make sure you click **Done** once finished with your settings to save any changes.

### Adding Filters to the Dashboard <a href="#_q0nk2e52jm7b" id="_q0nk2e52jm7b"></a>

**Filters** can be added to our dashboards to allow for a wider range of applications, as well as to avoid any repetitive work.

Filters are usually applied in:

*
  * **Dashboard templates**, to analyze different items, such as protocols, chains, and tokens.
  * **Time filtering**, to easily change between different time ranges and analyze any trend changes.

### Creating a Dashboard with a Filter <a href="#_7afqy9hvj5t6" id="_7afqy9hvj5t6"></a>

To set up filters on a new dashboard:

Step 1: Create a dashboard without any filter.

Dashboard items can have filters individually, but for more complex applications, it is more practical to just create a dashboard filter that is applied to the items inside of it. You can then set which item you want to associate with the dashboard filter.

**Note:** If the charts you selected already have filters on them, you can delete the filters manually. To delete filters:

Step 1: Click on Advanced.

Step 2: Under Filter, click on the x mark on your unwanted filters.

Step 3: Make sure you Save to keep any changes made.

The image above shows users how to manually delete filters that may come with some charts.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/19 (1)>)

The gif above demonstrates how to delete filters from charts manually.

Step 2: For multiple charts, you can add a filter linkage. Click on **add a filter** on the top right corner, and select the type of filter you would like. You can choose **Time**, **ID**, **Location**, and **Other Categories**. For the purpose of this example, we will select **Time**.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/20)

The image above shows where the **Add a filter** button is located and the available **filters you can use**.

Step 3: Select the type of filter. In this case, we will use **Month and Year**. You will be provided with different options for each filter as well.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (3)>)

The image above shows that you need to further specify your filters, with this one being Month and Year.

Step 4: Select the chart you want to associate with the drop-down **filters** on each chart, then set your **Default Value** as needed before clicking **Done** to finalize your settings.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (10)>)

The image above shows users where to set their filters and default value.

Step 1: Click on the **filter name** on the top left corner of your screen under your dashboard name.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (9)>)

The image above shows where the filter name is in your dashboard.

Step 2: Click on the **Remove** button on the right hand-side of the screen under Settings. Don’t forget to click **Done** to save your settings.
